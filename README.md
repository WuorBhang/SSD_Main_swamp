# Floods-monitoring-with-SAR

The detection of flooded areas in SAR satellite images is carried out. A multimodal function is adjusted to the histogram of each SAR image and statistics are obtained that allow the discrimination of the zones.


Satellite Data:
 - Sentinel-1. SAR in C-Band C.  Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode. VV polarisation.
